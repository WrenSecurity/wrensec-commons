# ForgeRock Documentation Tools 3.0.0 Release Notes

ForgeRock Documentation Tools is a catch all for
the doc Maven plugin,
default branding and common content,
sites where we post documentation,
and the documentation about documentation.

The link to the online issue tracker is
<https://bugster.forgerock.org/jira/browse/DOCS>.


## Compatibility

**Changes to default output formats**

With the fix for DOCS-189, RTF is no longer a default format.
As a result, you should no doubt remove links to in-progress RTF documents.

**Changes to plugin execution goals**

The fix for DOCS-108 is a major refactoring of the doc Maven plugin.

As a result of the refactoring, the plugin now has these goals:

*   A `pre-site` phase `process` goal to pre-process documents
*   A `pre-site` phase `build` goal to generate output
*   A `site` phase `site` goal to copy documents to a site layout
*   A `site` phase `release` goal to copy documents to a release layout

All configuration elements can be used in the top-level plugin configuration,
rather than the per-execution configurations.

These changes mean that you must update your POM in order to use this version.
See the README for this version for details.

**Changes to plugin configuration**

The fix for DOCS-240 replaces configuration parameters
`<include>` and `<excludes>` with `<formats>`.

The fix for DOCS-239 eliminates configuration settings
not generally set by any projects using the plugin.

The fix for DOCS-237 introduces a new configuration parameter, `<skipUrlPatterns>`.

The fix for DOCS-216 introduces a new configuration parameter,
`<doCreateArtifacts>`, to build artifacts from pre-processed sources.
See the explanation below for details.

Due to changes in the plugin architecture,
the fix for DOCS-194 in this release does not provide
the configuration option `<overwriteGeneratedSource>`,
but instead provides similar capability through other settings.
See the explanation below for details.

The fix for DOCS-144 makes Bootstrap-styled HTML and PDF the default formats.
To build other formats, set the `formats` property as in `-Dformats=xhtml5`.

**Changes to source code licensing**

ForgeRock doc build tools have moved to CDDL to align with other ForgeRock projects.


## What's New

**DOCS-264: Refine PDF naming for release documentation**

The fix allows the plugin to handle project names that include spaces.

**DOCS-261: Allow building output formats from pre-processed DocBook XML 5**

If the DocBook XML sources have already been fully pre-processed,
set `<usePreProcessedSources>true</usePreProcessedSources>`
(or `-DusePreProcessedSources=true`)
and set `<docbkxSourceDirectory>` (or `-DdocbkxSourceDirectory`)
to the file system directory containing the pre-processed sources.

**DOCS-239: Reduce the list of configuration settings**

This change removes these configuration settings, relying instead on the default values:

*   `<ansi>`: `true`
*   `<areSectionsAutolabeled>`: `true`
*   `<chunkedHTMLCustomization>`: `${project.build.directory}/docbkx-stylesheets/html/chunked.xsl`
*   `<docbkxModifiableSourcesDirectory>`: `${project.build.directory}/docbkx-sources`
*   `<docbkxOutputDirectory>`: `${project.build.directory}/docbkx`
*   `<doesSectionLabelIncludeComponentLabel>`: `true`
*   `<epubCustomization>`: `${project.build.directory}/docbkx-stylesheets/epub/coredoc.xsl`
*   `<foCustomization>`: `${project.build.directory}/docbkx-stylesheets/fo/coredoc.xsl`
*   `<fontsDirectory>`: `${project.build.directory}/fonts`
*   `<isXincludeSupported>`: `true`
*   `<javaScriptFileName>`: `uses-jquery.js`
*   `<manpagesCustomization>`: `${project.build.directory}/docbkx-stylesheets/man/coredoc.xsl`
*   `<preSiteCssFileName>`: `${project.build.directory}/coredoc.css`
*   `<releaseCssFileName>`: `${project.build.directory}/dfo.css`
*   `<singleHTMLCustomization>`: `${project.build.directory}/docbkx-stylesheets/html/coredoc.xsl`
*   `<useSyntaxHighlighting>`: `1` (true)
*   `<webhelpCss>`: `${project.build.dir}/docbkx-stylesheets/webhelp/positioning.css`
*   `<webhelpCustomization>`: `${project.build.dir}/docbkx-stylesheets/webhelp/coredoc.xsl`
*   `<webhelpLogo>`: `${project.build.dir}/docbkx-stylesheets/webhelp/logo.png`
*   `<xhtml5Customization>`: `${project.build.directory}/docbkx-stylesheets/fo/coredoc.xsl`

This change effectively reserves `${project.build.directory}/docbkx*` for use by this plugin.
This plugin uses `${project.build.directory}/fonts`,
`${project.build.directory}/coredoc.css` and `${project.build.directory}/dfo.css`.

This change also constrains the stylesheet names and layouts
that custom branding artifacts can use.


**DOCS-237: Provide a configuration parameter for passing skipUrl regexes**

This introduces a `<skipUrlPatterns>` parameter
that mirrors the one provided by `docbook-linktester`.

**DOCS-216: Provide pre-processed sources as Maven artifacts**

Unless you set `<doCreateArtifacts>` to `false`,
the plugin builds a Maven artifact from pre-processed documentation sources.

The resulting artifact is named `artifactId-version-doc-sources.jar`,
where `artifactId` and `version` are those of your project,
and the classifier is `doc-sources`.

When building output directly from pre-processed sources,
use the Maven dependency plugin to retrieve and unpack the sources
before you call this plugin.

    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <goals>
            <goal>unpack</goal>
          </goals>
          <phase>pre-site</phase>
          <configuration>
            <artifactItems>
              <artifactItem>
                <groupId>${myGroupId}</groupId>
                <artifactId>${myArtifactId}</artifactId>
                <version>${myVersion}</version>
                <classifier>doc-sources</classifier>
                <outputDirectory>${project.build.directory}/db-src</outputDirectory>
              </artifactItem>
            </artifactItems>
          </configuration>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>

Skip the `process` goal in the configuration for this plugin,
and instead specify `<docbkxSourceDirectory>` to pick up the pre-processed files.

**DOCS-235: Add PI for table header row color in PDF**

This makes the table header row background color light gray in PDF.

**DOCS-215: Add configuration for stopping at pre-processed DocBook**

Superseded by DOCS-216.

**DOCS-203: Provide a convention for copying arbitrary files to the built documentation**

The fix introduces two settings, `<copyResourceFiles>` (default: `false`),
and `<resourcesDirectory>` (default: `src/main/docbkx/resources`).

See the README for additional information. 


**DOCS-198: Build a cleaner version of the HTML**

You can now build XHTML5 that applies only default styles,
plus syntax highlighting.

XHTML5 is not built automatically. Specify the format as an include.

    mvn -Dformats=xhtml5 clean pre-site

The resulting documents are single pages, not chunked.


**DOCS-194:  Add option to allow merge of generated and docbkx source directories**

This release introduces a boolean option,
`<overwriteProjectFilesWithSharedContent>` (Default: `true`),
that allows you to prevent shared content from being overwritten
with shared content from the common content artifact.
To avoid overwriting existing files with shared content,
set the option to `false`.

One of the first things the plugin does when preparing DocBook sources
is to make a working copy of the files that is separate from the sources
in the `<docbkxModifiableSourcesDirectory>`.
This allows the plugin to make changes to the files as necessary.

If for some reason you must provide the copy yourself,
and your copy must be in the `<docbkxModifiableSourcesDirectory>`,
then to prevent the plugin from replacing the copy,
set `<overwriteModifiableCopy>` to `false`.
The plugin with then pre-process the copy, however,
so expect the files in your modifiable copy to be changed.


**DOCS-187: Documentation for legacy versions should not have the report bug footer**

The fix for this relies on a list of EOSL versions.
If the current version matches a version in the EOSL list,
then the footer is not shown in the HTML pages.

For the full list of EOSL versions, see the
[EOSL page at support.forgerock.com](https://support.forgerock.com/entries/24898647-Product-release-and-EOSL-dates).


**DOCS-178: Apply Maven resource filtering to .txt files as well**

The fix for this issue addresses both .txt and also .json files.


**DOCS-144: Style HTML output with Bootstrap UI**

The fix for this introduces a `bootstrap` format
that generates each document as a single HTML page styled with Bootstrap
and including a left-menu TOC on screens of appropriate size.

This fix also sets the default formats to the equivalent of `-Dformats=bootstrap,pdf`.


**DOCS-108: Reconsider forgerock-doc-maven-plugin architecture**

The fix for this issue is a major refactoring of the doc Maven plugin,
and a simplification of the plugin configuration model.

The new architecture is described in the Design document.

**DOCS-119: Support Maven 3.1 & 3.2**

The plugin has been tested with Maven 3.0.5, 3.1.1, 3.2.3.


## Fixes

**DOCS-244: Webhelp format does not include noindex,nofollow meta tag*

**DOCS-240: `<include>` (singular) and `<excludes>` are confusing**

This fix replaces those settings with `<formats>`.

**DOCS-233: Build plugin fails processing child module site**

**DOCS-225: Run docbook-linktester only on pre-processed DocBook files**

**DOCS-220: Chapter numbers should be included in WebHelp format**

**DOCS-213: Linktester phase in doc build plugin fails to detect broken links**

**DOCS-197: Prepending â†ª on mouseover is distracting**

**DOCS-189: Discontinue default support for RTF**

**DOCS-188: JavaScript icons in HTML to (un)fold screen are not accessible**

The fix removes the icons and (un)fold functionality.

**DOCS-184: Remove automatic line-breaking at the '?' character**

The fix only breaks URL lines longer than 80 characters in PDF.

**DOCS-179: Issue with Maven HTML builds and images**

**DOCS-150: When a code sample is unwrapped, it it not limited to the width of the page**

The fix for DOCS-188 removed the functionality that was causing the problem.

**DOCS-59: Only the draft documents are optimized to appear in Google searches; the final docs need to be SEO too.**

The fix adds a robots meta tag (noindex, nofollow) to site HTML,
that it then removes from release HTML.


## Known Issues

**DOCS-163: The performance="optional" attr in a step has no effect**

**DOCS-132: Soft hyphens used to break lines are rendered in PDF as hyphen + space**

Although soft hyphens are not used in this release,
the line break for hyphenation still remains.

See <https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/FOP-2358>.
