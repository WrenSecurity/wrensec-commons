## What's New

## Fixes

**DOCS-179: Issue with Maven HTML builds and images**


## Known Issues

**DOCS-163: The performance="optional" attr in a step has no effect**

**DOCS-150: When a code sample is unwrapped, it it not limited to the width of the page**

**DOCS-132: Soft hyphens used to break lines are rendered in PDF as hyphen + space**
